  The Kilton Public Library serves as a community hub by providing three meeting rooms that are available to the public, including one that seats up to 100 people. In addition to the meeting rooms, the library offers a gallery space showcasing the works of local artists, a kitchen, an AV system, and a beautiful courtyard. The Kilton Library is also the site of twenty-three community garden beds.
